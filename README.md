# 📊 Unemployment Analysis During COVID-19

## 🧠 Overview
This project explores the impact of the **COVID-19 pandemic on unemployment rates** using real-world data.  
The analysis is performed in **Google Colab** using Python libraries for **data cleaning, visualization, and trend interpretation**.

Through this project, we aim to understand how unemployment evolved over time, identify key patterns, and draw insights on post-pandemic recovery.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** – for data loading and manipulation  
- **Matplotlib** – for visualization  
- **Seaborn** – for advanced charts  
- **Google Colab** – for interactive coding environment  

---

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset is included in a ZIP file (`archive.zip`) containing CSV data on unemployment rates.  
It was extracted and processed using pandas for further analysis.

### Steps:
1. Upload dataset ZIP file to Colab  
2. Extract and load using pandas  
3. Clean missing or invalid entries  
4. Visualize unemployment trends over time

## 🔍 Project Workflow

### **Step 1 – Data Loading**
- Uploaded the dataset ZIP file to Google Colab  
- Extracted CSV and read into a pandas DataFrame  

### **Step 2 – Data Cleaning**
- Checked for missing values and inconsistencies  
- Converted date columns into datetime format  
- Filtered relevant columns for analysis  

### **Step 3 – Data Visualization**
- Created line plots showing unemployment trends over time  
- Compared year-wise averages and COVID-19 impact  
- Highlighted the recovery phase post-2021  

### **Step 4 – Insights**
- Clear **spike in unemployment** during early 2020 lockdowns  
- **Gradual recovery** observed post-2021  
- Data reflects both **economic vulnerability** and **resilience**  

### **Step 5 – Conclusion & Recommendations**
- Economic shocks like pandemics rapidly affect job stability  
- Targeted **government policies** and **stimulus programs** help recovery  
- Continuous **data monitoring** can provide early warning signs for future crises
